  2009/09/08 Converge 1.1

This release contains many minor fixes and enhancements. Major changes include:

  * Src infos are now triples (src file, src offset, len) meaning that error
    reporting is now much more detailed.

  * Parse trees have now changed representation from lists to instances of
    specific classes. Parse tree walking code needs to be updated accordingly.

  * Simple dynamic linking of core libraries.

  * Much enhanced backtraces (when curses is available).
