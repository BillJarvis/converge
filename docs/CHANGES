  2011/05/29 Converge 1.2

This release contains many portability fixes and optimisations. Converge should
now run with full optimisations on all major platforms.

There are also several compile-time meta-programming fixes, documentation
enhancments, and additional functions (e.g. File::temp_file). 


  2009/09/08 Converge 1.1

This release contains many minor fixes and enhancements. Major changes include:

  * Src infos are now triples (src file, src offset, len) meaning that error
    reporting is now much more detailed.

  * Parse trees have now changed representation from lists to instances of
    specific classes. Parse tree walking code needs to be updated accordingly.

  * Simple dynamic linking of core libraries.

  * Much enhanced backtraces (when curses is available).
