  Building from a Darcs checkout
 
If you have checked the source out via Darcs (i.e. you have not downloaded a
tar.gz file), you will first need to create the 'configure' script. This can be
created with the following command:

  make -f Makefile.bootstrap configure

You then execute the following as with any normal install:

  ./configure
  make -f Makefile.bootstrap
