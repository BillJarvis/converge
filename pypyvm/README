This directory contains an experimental PyPy VM for Converge. At least
initially, this is meant to be 100% backwards compatible with the C Converge
VM. Currently it is extremely incomplete and can only run toy examples. It
is likely that this VM will change rapidly as a better understanding of the
best way to do this is gained.

You first need to download the PyPy source distribution from
<http://pypy.org/download.html> (note that you do not need to build PyPy -
simply unpacking it is sufficient). You then need to define the PYPY_SRC
variable to point to the top-level pypy source directory. e.g. to perform
these steps in ~tmp do:

  $ cd ~
  $ mkdir -p tmp
  $ cd tmp
  $ hg clone https://bitbucket.org/pypy/pypy
  $ export PYPY_SRC=~/tmp/pypy

You can then either run the VM directly:

  $ python main.py <converge binary file>

Or translate it using PyPy:

  $ python $PYPY_SRC/pypy/translator/goal/translate.py --continuation --opt=0 main.py
  $ ./main-c <converge binary file>

All optimisation levels up to and including --opt=jit should work.
