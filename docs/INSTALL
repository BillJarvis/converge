Subject to platform specific notes in README.<platform> one can normally compile
Converge by executing the following commands:

  ./configure
  make


================================================================================

  Building from a Darcs checkout
 
If you have checked the source out via Darcs (i.e. you have not downloaded a
tar.gz file), you will first need to create the 'configure' script. This can be
created with the following command:

  make -f Makefile.bootstrap configure

Converge only keeps a bootstrap compiler for 64-bit machines in version control.
If you are running another type of machine, you will need to download a recent
snapshot and extract the appropriate bootstrap compiler and linker. e.g.:

  cp <snapshot>/bootstrap/<your machine type>/convergec.bootstrap bootstrap/<your machine type>
  cp <snapshot>/bootstrap/<your machine type>/convergel.bootstrap bootstrap/<your machine type>

You then execute the following as with any normal install:

  ./configure
  make

It is then recommended that you rebuild once more to check that the newly
compiled compiler functions correctly:

  make clean
  make

After this you're done - please feel free to contribute patches!
