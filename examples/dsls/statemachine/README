The examples in this directory show an example of a statemachine DSL evolving in
power and reliability. It is intended to show a small, but realistic, example of
DSL development. It is a good first starting point for learning about DSL
development in Converge.

Each evolution of the DSL comes with two files SMr.cv and exr.cv where r is
the DSL's version number. Therefore SM1.cv and ex1.cv are the starting
point. Each version of the DSL is runnable. e.g. to run the first version
type:

  $ converge -v ex1.cv

The DSL and its implementation will be compiled and run. The first three
versions are non-interactive, whereas the fourth and fifth versions require
input from the user.

  1: Very simple implementation allowing only states, transitions, and events.
     Events received by the system cause transitions to be taken; if no valid
     transition is found for a given event, an exception is raised.

  2: Guards (effectively preconditions), variables and simple actions (updating
     variables) on top of version 1. This is expressive enough for a decent
     subset of statemachines. The general format of a transition is:

       "TRANSITION" "FROM" <state> "TO" <state>: <event> "[" <guard> "]"
       "/" <action>

     where <event>, "[" <guard> "]", and "/" <action> are all optional.

     However there is a notable usability problem with this example. If the
     user makes a run-time mistake in their input - e.g. change one of the
     conditions to compare a number and a string - and the resulting run-time
     exception will be in terms of the SMr.cv file, not the exr.cv file. This
     makes debugging very hard.

  3: The same as version 2, but extra src infos are added to generated code.
     If you make the same run-time-exception-raising change to this version
     as you did to version 2, you will see that the resulting exception also
     pinpoints exactly where within the ex3.cv the error resulted from.

     This is achived by adding src infos to quasi-quoted code e.g.:

       [<node[1].src_infos>| ... |]

  4: Allow functions to be called from actions. Some "built in" functions are
     added to the statemachine (the input() function returns input from the
     user). Non-built in functions are assumed to be calls to user-defined
     functions outside the statemachine. This allows the statemachine in ex4.cv
     sufficient power to model a cash-machine including user input. To use the
     statemachine, first choose an account number (1 or 2), and then choose
     whether to Withdraw or Finish. If you withdraw, you will be asked for an
     amount; you can not overdraw an account.

     There is a subtle problem with this version of the DSL. If you use certain
     names for functions, then seemingly inexplicable behaviour occurs. Try for
     example renaming the read_card function (and all references to it) to
     "sm" which will trigger this problem. The reason this happens is that the
     DSL dynamically scopes references to unknown functions; in other words the
     read_card function is translated to an unmolested read_card variable
     without being renamed to a fresh name. Parts of the generated DSL code use
     - for their own convenience - dynamically scoped names too (e.g. "sm" which
     you will see in SM4.cv as "&sm"). In other words, this version of the DSL
     suffers from a hygiene problem.

  5: Same as version 4, but without the hygiene problem. This version of the DSL
     renames unknown functions such as read_card to a fresh name; in the
     generated code it then uses the rename declaration to ensure that the fresh
     name is the one in scope. This means that the generated code looks roughly
     as follows:

       rename read_card as $$20$$
       ...
       $$20$$(...)

     This version of the DSL thus solves the hygiene problem of version 4.
