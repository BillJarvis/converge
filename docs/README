  Converge documentation
================================================================================


  First time users
 ==================

If you are new to Converge and want to work out how to install it, check
install/INSTALL and then (if necessary) install/README.X where "X" is your
platform. You may then wish to read quick_intro/index.html for a whistle-top
tour of the language's major features.



  Detailed information
 ======================

If you wish to find out about all the documenation that comes with Converge,
herewith a brief description of the various documentation:

  CHANGES       A description of the major changes between versions

  CREDITS       A list of people

  ctmp/
    index.html  A detailed explanation of compile-time meta-progamming in
                Converge. This is, in a sense, a detailed addendum to the
                "quick intro".

  install/
    INSTALL     General installation instructions
    README.X    Specific instructions for platform X

  modules_html/
    index.html  Links to documentation on all parts of Converge's standard
                libraries. Note this documentation is built from the XML
                in the "modules_cvd" directory; modules_html is thus not
                populated until the whole Converge system is built.

  quick_intro/
    index.html  An overview of Converge's major language features.

  tools/
    index.html  Detailed explanations of the various tools (convergec,
                convergei, convergep, cvd_to_html) that come with
                Converge.
